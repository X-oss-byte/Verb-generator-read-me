> Generate your project's readme with verb. Requires verb v0.9.0 or higher.

## Install

Install globally with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i -g verb-readme-generator
```

If you do not already have verb installed globally, you can do that now with the following command:

```sh
$ npm i -g verb
```

## Usage

**Run the generator from the command line**

Once both [verb](https://github.com/verbose/verb) and verb-readme-generator are installed globally, you can run this generator with the following command:

```sh
$ verb readme
```

**Automatically run the generator**

In any project where you want this generator to automatically run with the `verb` command instead of `verb readme`, add the following to package.json:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  
  // add a verb config object with the tasks to run
  "verb": {
    "tasks": ["readme"]
  }
}
```

## Options

Configuration options can be passed on the command line, defined on the `verb` object in package.json, or set using the API.

Most of the following examples show how to set configuration values on the `verb` object _via the command line_, but you can also set these manually.

### toc

Disable or enable the Table of Contents in the built-in layouts:

**CLI**

One-time only (in-memory)

```sh
# enable
$ verb --toc
# disable
$ verb --toc:false
```

Persist the value to package.json:

```sh
# enable
$ verb --config=toc
# disable
$ verb --config=toc:false
```

Results in:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "verb": {
    "toc": false
  }
}
```

#### layout

Set the layout to use for a project.

```sh
$ verb --config=layout:default
```

**Available layouts**

As with all templates, you can easily override these and/or define your own templates in a `verbfile.js`. Verb does much more than generate readme's!

The following layouts are available:

* `default`: a layout with installation, tests, author, usage, related list, contributing and license sections.
* `global`: same as default, but with global npm installation instructions (verb-readme-generator uses this layout)
* `empty`: noop layout. no content is applied, but all layout-related middleware stages will still run.

Layouts can be defined on a template-by-template basic, and even for includes. If you need more granularity just add a `verbfile.js` with your custom code.
