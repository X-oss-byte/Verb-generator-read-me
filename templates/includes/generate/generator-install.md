**Installing the CLI**

To run the `{%= alias %}` generator from the command line, you'll need to install [Generate][] globally first. You can do that now with the following command:

```sh
$ npm install --global generate
```

This adds the `gen` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from any directory.

**Install {%= name %}**

Install this module with the following command:

```sh
$ npm install --global {%= name %}
```
