## Usage

With both `{%= name %}` and `generate` installed globally, you should now be able to run this generator's default task with the following command:

```sh
$ gen {%= alias %}
```

If the generator and its task completed successfuly, you should see something like this in the terminal:

```sh
[00:44:21] starting {%= alias %} generator
[00:44:21] starting {%= alias %}:default task
[00:44:22] finished {%= alias %}:default task 63ms
[00:44:22] finished {%= alias %} generator 68ms
[00:44:22] finished âœ”
```
