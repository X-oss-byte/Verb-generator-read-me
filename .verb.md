If you do not already have verb installed globally, you can do that now with the following command:

```sh
$ npm i -g verb
```

## Usage

**Run the generator from the command line**

Once both [verb][] and {%= name %} are installed globally, you can run this generator with the following command: 

```sh
$ verb {%= alias %}
```

**Automatically run the generator**

In any project where you want this generator to automatically run with the `verb` command instead of `verb readme`, add the following to package.json:

```js
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  
  // add a verb config object with the tasks to run
  "verb": {
    "tasks": ["readme"]
  }
}
```
